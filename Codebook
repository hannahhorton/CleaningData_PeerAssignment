#Project Description

run_analysis.R is a script that performs the necessary analysis and tranformation of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset from the UCI dataset repository. This script then create a clean version of the dataset that is exported into the text file tidyest_data.txt.

1. Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Each data file was attributed to a variable within the dataset:

feat_names <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

activity_labels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
contains test data of the volunteer test subjects being observed

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
contains train data of volunteer subjects being observed

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
contains testing data from the recorded measurements in 'feat_names'
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
contains training data from the recorded measurements in 'feat_names'

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
contains testing data of the activities recorded in 'activity_labels'
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 
contains testing data of the activities recorded in 'activity_labels'

3. Training and testing data is merged into a single dataset:

-Subject data is merged into a single column ('subject') using rbind()
-Activity data is merged into a single column ('activity') using rbind()
-Feature dat ais merged into a single column ('features') using rbind()
-subject, activity, and feature data is merged into a single dataset 'Data' using cbind()

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
tidy_data (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by selecting features containing the word 'mean' or 'std' and subsetting those columns into a new dataset.

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
The integers 1-6 in the activity column of tidy_data are replaced with the corresponding activity in activity_labels

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
Variable labels within feat_names are modified into human readable versions
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
All -mean() in column's name replaced by Mean
All -std() in column's name replaced by STD
All -freq() in column's name replaced by frequency
All angle in column's name replaced by Angle
All gravity in column's name replaced by Gravity

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

tidyest_data (180 rows, 68 columns) is created by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity. Data was then written into the text file tidyest_data.txt with the write.table() function.
